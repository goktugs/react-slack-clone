## Reflection

This was a 3 day long project. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation.  

It uses react router dom v5 which is old but more stable and well known.

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into Firebase, Google authentication.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 5.0, Firebase and Tailwind CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
